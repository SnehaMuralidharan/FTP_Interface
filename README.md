Job Ticket for a particular employee is created manually in the Transaction ZJTKT1, manually processing of job ticket is consuming lots of Time and man power, to increase the efficiency in the Job creation process.

An RFC function module ‘ZPP_CREATE_JOB_TICKET’ is created and the function module is used to communicate job ticket details from an external application to SAP and vice versa. 

 A new Excel Upload Program is developed in which Job creation details are fed in a excel with header details and uploaded, then the upload program will create job ticket automatically.
